As an experienced IT professional with over 13 years in the industry, I specialize in delivering high-value data solutions that drive business performance across sectors. My expertise lies at the intersection of Data Governance and Database Engineering, where I enable organizations to maximize the value of their data through well-structured governance frameworks, seamless integration, and resilient data architectures.

I have a strong track record of implementing enterprise-level data governance solutions using Informatica’s suite, including Axon, Enterprise Data Catalog (EDC), Metadata Manager, Analyst, and Data Privacy Management (DPM)—empowering businesses to achieve transparency, regulatory compliance, and trusted data access.

On the engineering front, I bring deep hands-on experience in ETL development, SQL Server BI (SSIS/SSRS), and advanced database design and tuning across platforms such as SQL Server, Oracle, and Teradata. My focus is always on building high-performing, governance-aligned data pipelines that deliver tangible results.

In addition, I’m proficient with tools like Tableau for data visualization, familiar with Python for scripting and automation, and experienced working in UNIX environments. I thrive in Agile settings, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to deliver technically sound, strategically aligned solutions.

I'm passionate about shaping data ecosystems that are trustworthy, accessible, and well-governed, and I welcome opportunities to connect with like-minded professionals who share this mission.
